# Latest Video Plugin
A small disclaimer here, I created this as a simple open-source solution to help you guys out. I tested it on a clean WordPress install and everything worked. But your website might be running with other custom functions, themes or code that could interfere. So proceed with caution, maybe ask a technical person to help you out and always  make sure you have a back-up in case something goes wrong. I am no means responsible for anything that might possibly break!
